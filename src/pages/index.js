            Hey there. I'm glad you stopped by. I started coding more seriously
            in late 2017, in the goal of becoming a front-end dev by 2019.
            Thanks to a great company, I was able to jump from CX to ITs in
            November 2018. They tried me part-time for 2 months and then hired
            me full-time. I'm still working there and it's amazing. Moral of the
            story: worship Cthulhu.
